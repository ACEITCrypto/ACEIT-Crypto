ACEIT is a cryptocurrency designed for the gambling industry, with a fixed supply of 525 million tokens. Although gambling is often viewed negatively, our project aims to highlight its positive potential by contributing to charitable causes. A percentage of the proceeds from ACEIT will be donated to charity, demonstrating our commitment to giving back and making a positive impact despite the industry's challenges.
